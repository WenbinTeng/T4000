# T4000

This is a repository for a computing system based on Intel MCS-4 (in memory of Gordon Moore on 2023-03-24), comprising four 4000 series components, namely 4001 ROM, 4002 RAM, 4003 SR, and 4004 CPU. The instruction set in MCS-4 allows both binary and decimal arithmetic, including conditional branching, jump to subroutine, and indirect fetching.
